# aoc-submissions

A small website showcasing different solutions for the Advent of Code.

[The live page can be found here.](https://melfkammholz.github.io/aoc-submissions/)

## Local Development

Since the page uses ES6 modules, you'll need a web server to test the page locally. If you have Python installed, you can e.g. run

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```
